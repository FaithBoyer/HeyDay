Hey Day is a uniquely Auburn tradition, set up to create a friendly, connected environment on campus.
In light of the current pandemic :mask: it isn't possible for everyone in the Auburn community to participate directly. This is the perfect time to use new skills, learned through
Auburn University, to make participation more accessible.

So, from one Auburn student to anyone wanting to participate, hey, and **war eagle!**

It's great to be an Auburn Tiger :orange_heart::blue_heart:
